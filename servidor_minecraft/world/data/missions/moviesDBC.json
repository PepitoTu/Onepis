However, fearing that the monster might reappear someday, the brothers are separated, each sealed in a music box and shot into opposite ends of the galaxy. But it seems somehow, that the black magician Hoi manages to release the lower part of Hirudegarn. Tapion then ask you to kill him in order to prevent the other half to be released! However, Hoi and the lower half of the Hirudegarn appear to stop anyone from killing Tapion. The power of the lower half causes the upper half in Tapion's body to react and release itself. Hoi succeeds in his plans, and with the monster back together, he believes nothing can stop him."
